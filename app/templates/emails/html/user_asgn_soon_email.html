<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
    The assignment "{{ assignment.title }}" is due pretty soon. Today, in fact.
</p>
<p>
    Do solve it if you can. If you can't figure it out or you have a good reason to not do it,
    then don't worry - you can solve the assignment after the deadline, or you can bring a printed / saved
    attempt to class for me to see.
</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Jack</p>
