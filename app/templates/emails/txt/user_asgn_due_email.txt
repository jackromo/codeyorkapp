Hey,

Assignment "{{ assignment.title }}" was due today, but it looks like you didn't complete it.

The missed deadline's been recorded for admin purposes. Don't worry - one missed homework isn't the end of the world! If you're getting alot of these warnings though, I might want to talk to you about it.

In any case, you can - and should - still try and finish the assignment. Submitting a few minutes after these due dates is totally fine.

If you still can't solve it, save what you've written to a file / print it, and bring it to class so I can see. I'm more than happy to go through certain assignment solutions in class.

Best,
Jack
